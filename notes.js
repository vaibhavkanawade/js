//what is javascipt
//javascipt is high level interpreted programming language
//Prilimary use for fronted development

//what is high level
//high level means easy to understands and deals with loop and function

//what is interpreted
//interpreted means not comiple before it can run


//what are the data types in javascript?
//primitive datatype
//1)string 2)symbol 3)null 4)number 5)undefined 6)boolean
//non-primitive
//object

// let str = "Hello javascript";
// console.log(typeof str);
// //op:string

// let num = 5;
// console.log(typeof num);

// let a = 2;
// let b = 3;
// console.log(typeof (a == b)); // returns false
// let x; // value of x is undefined
// let y = undefined; // we can also set the value of a variable as undefined
// console.log(typeof (x, y));
// let z = null;
// console.log(typeof z);
// let symbol1 = Symbol('symbol');
// console.log(typeof symbol1);
// let obj1 = {
//     x: 43,
//     y: "Hello world!",
//     z: function () {
//         return this.x;
//     }
// }
// console.log(typeof obj1);



// var word ="hello";
// let letter="A";
// const num = 12;

//what is diffence between let var and const?
//1)let and const are block scoped while var is function scope
//2)hoisting not possible in let and const but in var hoisting is possible
//3)ES6 introduced let and const and var is before ES6 introduced
//4)let and const redecalration not allowed but var redecalation is allowed






//what is Hoisting in javascipt?
//Hoisting is javascipt behavior where the variable and function declartion are moved to the top of their  containing scope during the compilation phase.

//what is closure in javascipt?
//closure are the function that have to access the variable from function from the another function scope is called as closure

// function outerFunction() {
//     let variable1 = "outer function ";
//     function inner() {
//         console.log(variable1);

//     }
//     return inner;
// }

// let closure = outerFunction();
// closure();


//what is callback
//callback are the function passed as an argument to the another function is called as callback function

// function hello() {
//     console.log("hello world");
// }
// setTimeout(hello, 2000);


// function sum(a, b) {
//     console.log(a + b);
// }

// function calculator(a, b, sum) {
//     sum(a, b);
// }

// calculator(1, 2, sum);


//what is callback Hell
//nested callback is called callback hell



//what is this keyword in javascipt?
//this refer to the object on which method is being invoked or the object that is currently executing the function


//what is diffence between == and === in javascipt?
//== is also equality oprator but does not check datatypes only check values or equality
//=== it is strict equality oprator but check datatypes as well as values

//what is event delegation in javascipt?
//event delegation is technique where a single event listener is attached to a comman anestor rather than the individual element. It utilized event bubbleing to manage events efficiently

//what is promises in javascipt?
//A promises is an object reprsenting the eventual compilation or failure of an asychronous opration
//it allows handling asychronous oprations more effectively than using callback


//what is Arrow function in javascipt?
//Arrow function are concious way to write a function in javascript
//Arrow function is ES6 introduced
//Arrow function syntax is easy
//does not bind their own this value

//what is higher order function?
//Higher order function are the function passed as an argument to another function and return function

//what is event loop in javasript?
//It continously checks the message queue new events to process

//what is Anonymous function ?
// //Anonymous function is that type of function that has no name or we can say which is without any name

// let x = function () {
//     console.log("It is anonymous function ");
// };
// x();


//what is JSON.stringify()?
//JSON.stringify() static method converts a javascipt value to JSON string value


//what is BOM?
//BOM stand for Browser object model.
//It allows to intract with the browser.

//slice = create a new array in javascipt
//splice = method does not create a new array

//Object.values Return only value in object into the array

//javascript is single threaded language
//javascipt is a single threaded language because while running code on a single thread it can be really easy to implement as we don't have to deal with the complicated scenarios that arise in the multi threaded environment like a deadlock since javascipt is single threaded language it is sychronous in nature .


//what is variable in javascipt
